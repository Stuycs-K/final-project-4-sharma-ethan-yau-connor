# APCS2 Final Project
THIS DOCUMENT IS REQUIRED
## Group Info
Ethan Sharma and Connor Yau

Group Name: Wutdagiatt
## Overview
This project is a graphing calculator in processing. The calculator will feature basic operations, trigonometric functions, graphing and other functions of a graphing calculator. Many of the features will be standard operation calculation, but we use processing mainly to show the graphing of a function to estimate what the exact graph should look like. Specific features we have is all trigonometric functions, an Answer feature so you don't have to retype it (like a real graphing calculator), constants like e and pi, logarithms and mods, multiple graphs, and editing the graphing window with scale and bounds. We did not use any libraries for this project.
## Instructions
Type any calculation into the menu and watch it calculate. You must close all your parenthesis when doing this. You can use any of the constants or Ans within your expression, and the calculator will parse it as its value. You are also able to travel back with the arrow buttons to see history or throughout your current line with the left/right arrows. When you are selecting a number, you can either delete it with the del button or replace it with a different number. You can also bring past results or expressions from previous lines to the current line. To graph, click the 'gMenu' button and input your functions, then click the 'graph' button. Yuo can edit the graph window by pressing the 'win' button, and return to the main calculator with the 'main' button.

**Bug**. In a real graphing calculator, when typing functions like sin or log the selector would treat it as one entity, but this calculator treats it as three different letters, so don't delete or replace any of the three without completely changing it or it will break. We have built in Error messages so any invalid input will output "Error" instead of crashing, so this will not crash the calculator.

**Note**. There is NO implicit multiplication on this calculator. So, an input of 5(4) would not work, and instead you would need to type 5\*4 or 5\*(4).
