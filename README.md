## Overview
We plan on coding a graphing calculator in processing. The calculator will feature basic operations, trigonometric functions, graphing which includes tracing, functions, matrices, and as many other useful applications and functions of a graphing calculator. Many of the features will be standard operation calculation, but we use processing mainly for the graphing using an estimation of the derivatives of a function at a point so that a point can trace out the graph. Some other cool stuff planned is matrix operations, integration, and slope fields.
